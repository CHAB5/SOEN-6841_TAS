\normalsize {Even with the obvious benefits of purchasing ready-made software, there is still a significant issue with project management and organizational effectiveness. The main difficulty appears in the post-contract stages, especially when it comes to integrating new software and modifying old systems. In their quest for expedited deployment and economical efficiency, organizations frequently encounter unanticipated challenges that may compromise the projected advantages of ready-made solutions. The challenge of precisely determining whether the features promised in demos will smoothly mesh with particular company and product area requirements complicates this issue.\\

After a contract is signed, the testing phase highlights the inherent complexity of modification and integration, which can result in cost overruns and disruptions to business operations. The lack of a comprehensive and regulated pre-contract evaluation process worsens this problem even further, leaving businesses open to compatibility problems that could arise once the software is made available to end users. Therefore, the problem statement centers on the requirement for a methodical and thorough procurement procedure, with the goal of filling in any gaps and guaranteeing that the functions anticipated during the process of procurement precisely match the organization's real-world requirements. In an effort to shed light on this ongoing issue, this inquiry advocates for a proactive and comprehensive pre-contract evaluation method in order to reduce risks and improve the overall performance of ready-made software.\\

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{3. Defining Terms}
\section*{3. Defining Terms}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Readymade software: Software that has been pre-packed with preset features that are difficult to alter is referred to as "readymade" or "packaged" software. These commercial items are usually offered to businesses of different sizes as a one-time purchase or on a subscription basis. Because the features are made to be simple to use, you can utilize them right away after buying. Because of its well-established technology and intuitive user interface, packaged software is frequently considered the best option for integrating technologyâ€”that is, unless it is a recently released product. Choosing ready-made software has benefits and drawbacks, which we shall discuss in more detail in the section that follows.

    \item Legacy System: Any old computer system (hardware and software combined) that is still in use is called a legacy system. Programming languages, file formats, software programs, and computer hardware are all included in this category of outdated technology. That being said, it's important to remember that many legacy systems are still in good working order despite being obsolete. Businesses usually choose to stick with legacy systems that are essential to their day-to-day operations and fulfillment of business needs.

    \item Due diligence report: Software due diligence, often a part of technology due diligence, is evaluating and assessing the software engineering and code base, with a focus on potential risks resulting from issues including poor quality, unreliable technological foundations, and inadequate scalability. The fact that a software due diligence is occasionally provided in conjunction with a technological, technical, or even IT due diligence does not adequately convey the intricacy of the subject. To avoid errors, investors should make sure that the appropriate scope, knowledge, and analysis techniques are applied. 

    \item Vendor evaluation: Vendor evaluation is the process of evaluating and approving possible suppliers and vendors to make sure they can fulfill the requirements and standards specified by an organization after a contract is signed. The ultimate goal is to create a portfolio of suppliers and vendors that is high-quality and low-risk. Even though the vendor assessment process might be difficult, there are benefits, such as being able to find low-risk suppliers of excellent products and services. It also encourages the development of long-lasting, mutually beneficial commercial partnerships.

\section*{3. Benefits and Drawbacks of using Ready-Made Software}
\subsubsection*{3.1 Major benefits of using ready-made software}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3.1 Major benefits of using ready-made software}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Immediate implementation: Businesses are able to quickly integrate and make use of the system thanks to the quick deployment and purchase of ready-made software. This is a major advantage of using ready-made software since it provides functionality tailored to the sector quickly. As a result, companies avoid wasting time on unnecessary steps and may focus on other organizational improvements. This is in contrast to the sometimes drawn-out process of developing custom software.

    \item Cost-effective: Industry analysts argue that buying premade software is an attractive option due to its low costs and improved return on investment (ROI). Compared to custom-built software, packaged software solutions are typically less expensive because they are not usually customized to meet the specific demands of the user and have less flexibility.

    \item Proven technology: Pre-made software has been tested and used by many clients, demonstrating its dependability and applicability to a wide range of users. Users can evaluate the effectiveness and assistance offered by the companies that sell the packaged software.

    \item Immediate Assistance and Ongoing Enhancements: The majority of ready-made software providers provide thorough documentation and technical support, which is especially helpful for companies that are not familiar with the program. To ensure best use, these software packages also include user manuals and training materials. Additionally, since suppliers continuously release updates and bug fixes to guarantee the software's continued proper functionality, businesses who use prepackaged software are spared of maintenance issues.

    \item Tailoring and Scalability: As was previously said, pre-configured features in off-the-shelf IT solutions make them difficult to modify to meet changing needs. Many pre-made software solutions are built to handle large amounts of data and are easily expandable with readily available add-ons to meet the expanding needs of the organization as it grows.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{3.2 Drawbacks of using ready-made software}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3.2 Drawbacks of using ready-made software}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Less Flexible for Growing Requirements:Although ready-made software initially satisfies particular objectives, it frequently lacks the flexibility needed to accommodate changing organizational requirements. These solutions can find it difficult to scale properly or accept additional functionalities as firms expand and change, which would limit customisation.

    \item Feature Rich but with Unused Functions: There are many functions included in off-the-shelf software packages, some of which might not be needed for a given business. This may lead to a confusing user interface, more training costs, and possible inefficiencies as users pick through features that have no bearing on their daily tasks.

    \item Dependency on Publisher for Maintenance: Businesses that use off-the-shelf software are at the mercy of the publisher for upkeep, upgrades, and compliance with an application's lifespan. Due to this dependence, important updates may not be implemented on time, putting the company at risk for security breaches and preventing it from using the newest features.

    \item Absence of Attention to Needs: Pre-made software might not meet all of an organization's unique needs. Workflows and business processes may be compromised as a result of this misalignment because the software may not accurately meet the organization's specific requirements.

    \item Lack of Ownership and Control: Customers that purchase off-the-shelf software have no influence over how the product is developed and improved. A lack of control and ownership over the product's progress results from customization possibilities that are frequently limited to what the software publisher permits.

    \item Long-term Cost Implications: Although ready-made software might first appear to be affordable, there may be long-term expenses involved. Before settling on a ready-made solution, it is crucial to carefully consider the long-term cost implications because customization, continuing support, and prospective licensing fees for extra features can all add up to unexpected charges.
